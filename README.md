Project Prototype

For this assignment, you will be creating a working prototype of your project idea.  

This will be a working end product that can be deployed and usable.  Your project will consider what you have learned in previous assignments, with the necessary changes based on user input.  Unless you have permission from your instructor for a project change, this project must be for the same project idea as previous assignments. This end product will be in the form of a website made in google sites. The website must meet the general requirements, as well as demonstrate your acquired knowledge in Ideation and Validation (market analysis), User Interface and User Experience Design, Implementation (coding), and Testing.

Website Requirements:
A welcome page
An about us/ contact us page
An embedded google form
Embedded html code (Look to your GitHub Pages assignment)
An FAQ page
A website banner
An embedded Youtube video
Google sites “Layouts”
Three additional google site elements (Ex. Calendar, map, button, etc)

With the previous assignments, it would be assumed that your end product has changed and grown from your original idea. Along with submitting your final product, you will also submit a paper.  This will be about one page in length.  In this paper please describe your process of creating your product.  Be sure to use relevant terms to prove your content knowledge.  Be sure to talk about changes you decided on, as well as things that have stayed consistent.
